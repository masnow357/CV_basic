		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a self-taught web developer with a strong passion for coding and a continuous drive to learn and improve my skills. I have taken numerous courses, tutorials, and extensively studied documentation pages to establish a solid foundation in web development.</p>
		<p>In addition to my professional experience, I enjoy exploring personal projects that showcase my creativity and technical abilities. For instance, I have developed applications such as a Pokedex using third-party APIs, an animated typing effect, a challenging AI-based tic-tac-toe game, and a web application that incorporates face recognition.</p>
		<p>Apart from coding, I am an avid reader, passionate gamer, and enjoy drawing and playing basketball during my free time. These hobbies provide me with a balanced approach to life and help me maintain a well-rounded perspective.</p>
		<p>I am a motivated and enthusiastic developer, always seeking opportunities to expand my skill set, stay updated with the latest industry trends, and contribute to meaningful projects. I am eager to take on new challenges and make a positive impact in the field of web development.</p>
